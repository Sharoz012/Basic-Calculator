**Simple Calculator in C**
A basic command-line calculator written in C that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

Features
Addition (+)

Subtraction (−)

Multiplication (×)

Division (÷) with zero-division check

User-friendly text-based interface

Infinite loop until the user exits

How It Works
The program runs a continuous loop prompting the user to choose an operation from a menu. Once the user inputs their choice and two numbers, the calculator performs the operation and displays the result. It exits only when the user selects option 5.

**Simple Calculator**
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit
Choose an operation (1-5): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
Error Handling
Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.
